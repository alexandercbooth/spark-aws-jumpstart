![](images/spark-logo-trademark.png)

## [Module I](01-Module-1.md)
In the first part, we are going to have the following goals:
1. signup for aws
2. configure aws
3. launch a spark cluster
4. spark basics

HW 1: Configure aws and fire up a :collision: cluster. Take a screen shot of the cluster up and running and save it a markdown file `HW-01-yourname.md` inside the submission folder. Then use the submission procedure below for submitting.

## Submitting HW
We will use the git workflow for submitting HW (it's pass or fail)
1. fork the repo on github
2. clone it from your name
`git clone http://github.com/your-gh-name/spark-aws-jumpstart.git`
3. change directory `cd spark-aws-jumpstart`
4. create and checkout feature branch
`git checkout -b yourName-hw`
5. complete the assignment and stage your chages
`git add my-file`
6. commit with proper commit message
`git commit -m "chore: adding assignment 1"`
7. push your changes to your repo
`git push origin yourName-hw`
8. open a PR on github and submit
9. party time :tada:
