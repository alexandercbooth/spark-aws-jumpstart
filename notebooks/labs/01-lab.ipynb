    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to begin to become comfortable with wrangling RDDs and learning the basic RDD API. Ultimately, we want to count the words in a RDD and have output like the following,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: <your-code-here>\n",
    "\n",
    "Out[1]: [(u'OR', 7),\n",
    "         (u'THE', 6),\n",
    "         (u'IN', 4),\n",
    "         (u'OF', 4),\n",
    "         (u'SOFTWARE', 3),\n",
    "         (u'FOR', 2),\n",
    "         (u'IS', 2),\n",
    "         (u'OTHER', 2),\n",
    "         (u'ANY', 2),\n",
    "         (u'WARRANTY', 1),\n",
    "         (u'USE', 1),\n",
    "         (u'COPYRIGHT', 1),\n",
    "         (u'WHETHER', 1),\n",
    "         (u'BUT', 1),\n",
    "         (u'HOLDERS', 1),\n",
    "         (u'WITH', 1),\n",
    "         (u'KIND', 1),\n",
    "         ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.\n",
    "Begin by reading the file into a RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the spark context from the spark session (avaiable at `spark.sparkContext`) to read the file into a RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.\n",
    "Use a `flatMap` to parse the rdd into what looks like a list of words. Create a function that will do this.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[u'THE',\n",
    " u'SOFTWARE',\n",
    " u'IS',\n",
    " ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.\n",
    "Strip any punctuation from the words. Do this however you think is best, by creating a function and applying it to the RDD by using a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.\n",
    "Now, to set yourself up to better wrangle the rdd, change it from a flat RDD to a RDD that has the structure of a tuple for each entry, where the first entry in the tuple is a word and the second entry is the number 1. Create a function that does this and apply it to your RDD by using a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.\n",
    "use the groupyByKey method to groupBy. This will now change the tuples to the following form,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(word, <iterator>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. \n",
    "Now, take advantage of the iterator created above and apply a sum function to it with a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.\n",
    "Finally, sort the result by value using the `sortBy()` method and descending order. Display only the first 10\n",
    "\n",
    "## If time allows\n",
    "Instead of groupingBy the key, replace steps 5 and 6 with a `reduceByKey()`. This is much more efficient and will not create an expensive shuffle."
